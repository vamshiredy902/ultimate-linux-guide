# What is chmod?

chmod stands for change mode — it's a command used to change the permissions of a file or directory.

# Why File Permissions Matter

Every file or folder in Linux has permissions that define who can:

r → read

w → write

x → execute

# These permissions are set for three types of users:

Owner (u)

Group (g)

Others (o)
